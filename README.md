</div>

### Description

I have searched psc for a way to put images on a access database and all that i could find was complicated code so i decided to do it myself and a few minutes later i have come to this...a simple way to store any file on a database field.

Note that im not using BLOB field here....

Its simple and it works two most important things to me... hope you enjoy.
